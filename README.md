# TV-OAT
The website consists of four main sections: the Home page, the Series page, the Movies page, and the Characters page.

The Home page is well-structured and divided into three main sections. The top section provides a brief and light introduction to TV series, followed by a section dedicated to movies, and a third section focused on characters. At the top of the page, a featured series image is displayed to enhance the visual appeal.

The Series page is organized into multiple cards. Each card includes a series image, short details about the series, and a button that directs the user to a dedicated page with full information about that series.
The Movies page follows the same structure and design, displaying movie cards with an image, a brief description, and a button leading to the movie’s detailed page.

The Characters page is also card-based. Each card contains a character’s image, name, and a button that navigates to a page dedicated to providing detailed information about that character.
# TV Shows
Pages dedicated to characters consist of several interconnected and professionally organized pages.
The first page is divided into two main sections:
The first section displays the series image and title, along with essential information such as the number of episodes, number of seasons, production date, and other details, in addition to a brief summary of the series storyline.
The second section features images of the characters, highlighting the main characters, and includes a button that directs the user to the next page.
The second page contains the same first section but without the navigation button. The second section presents a trailer for the series, with a list of seasons displayed on the side. Selecting a season redirects the user to another page.
On this new page, the first section remains the same, but instead of the series synopsis, it displays images of the main characters. The second section replaces the trailer with a list of episodes. Selecting an episode takes the user to the viewing page.
The viewing page includes a player at the top that allows navigation between episodes. A small sidebar on the side enables quick switching between episodes, while the main viewing screen is centered on the page.

# Movie
The Movies section also consists of several interconnected and well-organized pages.
The first page is similar to the Series section and is divided into two main parts: one dedicated to characters and actors, and another that presents the main movie information.
On the second page, instead of seasons, there are two main buttons: a Download button and a Watch button. When the Watch button is selected, the user is taken to a viewing interface. At the top of this page, there is a navigation bar that includes a Download button and a button to return to the movie details page.
When the Download button is pressed, the user is redirected to a dedicated page for downloading the movie, where the available download options are clearly presented.

# CHARACTERS
The Characters section consists of a single dedicated page. This page is divided into two main sections.
The first section focuses on the character itself and includes the character’s image, name, age, occupation, and the series they belong to, along with a dedicated area presenting the character’s story and background.
The second section is dedicated to the actor who portrays the character. This section is organized into two parts: the first part is presented as a card containing the actor’s image, name, biographical information, and awards and nominations. The second part highlights the actor’s most notable and popular works.
